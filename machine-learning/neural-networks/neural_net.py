This neural network is very simple. Each column has its own pool of Neurons. A
Neuron is created for every unique name in the database. (XXX: should this be
for each unique name in a column?) Each Neuron's name is used as a key in a
dictionary, whose value is a list of all the Neurons it excites, beginning with
itself. The other Neurons in a Neuron's pool are inhibitors.
