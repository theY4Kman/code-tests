# YakOS

This was an attempt to follow the [BrokenThorn OS development tutorials](http://www.brokenthorn.com/Resources/OSDevIndex.html), from bootloader to an OS with a terminal where executables could be run. YakOS never reached that stage, but the learning was fun. It's a reminder how much is taken for granted during daily computer use. And as I dig, I feel a connection with the people who put thought time into the machinery (kinda goes something like "what the fuck? that's crazy! who the shit would do it like that?", then minutes later, "ah... I see. I would've done the same thing").

As far as I know, this thing still runs. You'll need nasm for compilation. `make` should produce a vfloppy.img file, which can be loaded as floppy into your favourite virtual machine software.
